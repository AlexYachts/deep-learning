# Udacity Deep-Learning Nanodegree Portfolio

This repository includes projects from the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.

## Projects

* [Modeling trends](https://github.com/AlexYachts/deep-learning/tree/master/first-neural-network): a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.
* [Image classification](https://github.com/AlexYachts/deep-learning/tree/master/breed_classifier): a convolutional neural network implemented in Keras to identify different dog breeds. The model is improved through the use of transfer learning.
* [Text generation](https://github.com/AlexYachts/deep-learning/blob/master/tv-script-generation/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb): a recurrent neural network in TensorFlow to generate new scripts based on scripts from The Simpsonâ€™s.
* [Image generation](https://github.com/AlexYachts/deep-learning/blob/master/face_generation/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb): a DCGAN trained on the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces and on the MNIST dataset to create images of digits.
